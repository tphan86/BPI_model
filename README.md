# Bateriophage Interaction Model

The code was run using the version of MATLAB R2023b with global optimization toolbox installed. `Genetic Algorithm` and `Pattern Search` were
utilized to fit the model to the growth experimental data of four pathogenic strains *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Paenibacillus larvae* treated by cocktail of phages and Phage Fern_IDv1 (PA103 Rd3, PAK Rd3, Y3650 Fern, Y25747 Fern).
